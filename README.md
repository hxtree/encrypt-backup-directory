# Make Encrypted Backup of Each File

This is a simple python script to make an encrypted backup of each file in a directory.

Files are individually encrypted using GPG, which is widely supported on Linux.
Encryption is done using a AES256 cipher, which is approved for top-secret data.

This is one possible way of encrypting backups on premise before sending to cloud service.

This is designed more for individual file retrival.
